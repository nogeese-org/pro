Nogeese Pro Terms of Service

By using Nogeese Pro, you agree to the following terms and conditions:

1. Data Integrity & Modification Restrictions

    You cannot modify, alter, or delete any data stored on our servers.
    Any unauthorized attempts to alter server data will result in immediate termination of your access.

2. Redistribution & Commercial Use

    You cannot sell, resell, or distribute this service, its components, or related software without explicit permission.
    Open-source components of Nogeese Pro can be self-hosted, but usage of official servers requires a valid Nogeese One account.

3. Device Limit & Account Enforcement

    Nogeese Pro allows up to 25 devices per Nogeese One account.
    Attempting to bypass this limit through modification, circumvention, or multiple accounts will result in a ban from Nogeese One services.

4. Account Security & Responsibility

    You are responsible for keeping your Nogeese One account secure.
    Any unauthorized activity originating from your account is your responsibility, and Nogeese Pro is not liable for any consequences.

5. Data Privacy & Security

    While we take strong security measures, you acknowledge that cloud-based services inherently carry risks.
    Nogeese Pro is not responsible for data breaches, unauthorized access, or data loss caused by third-party interference.

6. Fair Usage Policy

    Excessive use of resources (including but not limited to bandwidth, storage, or processing power) that disrupts service for other users may result in temporary restrictions or account termination.

7. Compliance with Laws

    You must comply with all applicable local, national, and international laws when using Nogeese Pro.
    Any use of the service for illegal activities, hacking, or unauthorized modifications will lead to immediate termination and possible legal action.

8. Service Modifications & Termination

    We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue Nogeese Pro at any time.
    If services are discontinued, we will attempt to provide a reasonable notice period, but this is not guaranteed.

9. No Warranty & Limitation of Liability

    Nogeese Pro is provided "as is", without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied.
    We are not liable for any data loss, downtime, software failures, or indirect damages resulting from the use of the service.

10. Violation Consequences

    Violating any of these terms may result in:
        Temporary or permanent bans from Nogeese Pro and Nogeese One.
        Loss of access to Pro OS, Pro Updates, and Pro Security repos.
        Possible legal action in cases of severe violations.

If you do not agree with these terms, you should not use Nogeese Pro.
